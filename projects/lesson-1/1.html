  <h2>Pope Francis has a great trip to the US</h2>

    WASHINGTON - Pope Francis' gleaming white Alitalia plane - colloquially known as "Shepherd One" - touched down at Joint Base Andrews Tuesday, beginning a historic six-day, three-city visit that will have political, diplomatic and spiritual ramifications.

    Breaking from the usual protocol for a state visit, President Obama and Vice President Biden chose to greet the papal plane at the Air Force base outside Washington before Francis departed in a hatchback Fiat to begin his tightly scheduled, carefully choreographed and highly anticipated visit.

    He has an ambitious schedule: The pontiff will visit the White House, meet with U.S. Catholic bishops and celebrate a new saint with a canonization Mass for the Spanish missionary priest Junipero Serra on Wednesday. On Thursday, he'll be the first pope to address a joint meeting of Congress, and on Friday he'll address the nations of the world at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly.
