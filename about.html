                        How’s it going? I’m eager to serve as your president and excited to get this club rolling! I began coding several years ago, and since then it has become a personal passion. As a hobbyist and a freelancer, I design and develop websites for competitions, for businesses, and for sake of creating fun projects. I constantly try to expand my horizons with new design trends and new languages or frameworks, and I hope inspire some of you to explore the creative and evolving world of web development.

                        Hey! I’m thrilled to serve as your vice president for this semester. I started learning web design a few years ago and since then I have grown a lot in terms of my skills. Between freelancing, entering competitions, and designing websites for companies, I am constantly pushing myself and learning the latest in terms of web design trends and frameworks. Through our club, I hope to spark interest in and challenge you with this rapidly growing field.

                        What's up! I'm pumped to be serving as your secretary and co-founder of LWD for this upcoming semester. As someone who picked up website design by accident, I've come a long way since, tackling random projects with my friends and attending hackathons + competitions! Websites are becoming increasingly important in the booming tech industry, and I'm excited to help you explore the path towards mastering them.

                        Hey! I'm your treasurer this year. Along with a team of two great friends I've been coding since elementary school and taking web development semi-seriously since my freshman year of Lynbrook. I'm looking forward to helping you all learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript while introducing anyone interested to the .NET masterrace ;) Can't wait to meet everyone and help you in any way you need over the next few months.
