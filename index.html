                    <p>
                        HTML is the meat of a web page - it describes the content and general layout of a page.

                    <p>
                        CSS makes sites pretty - it describes the presentation and design of the underlying HTML.

                    <p>
                        Javascript is responsible for making things happen - it makes your website as interactive as you want.

                <p>
                    We hold weekly workshops for both beginners and veteran coders. Interested members with no prior experience have the opportunity to learn the basics of website development (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) through our weekly lessons and projects. Coders with more experience get to engage in more advanced workshops, which explore a number of topics including, but not limited to, PHP, AJAX, CSS3, and jQuery.

                <p>
                    Once every few months, members will have the opportunity to participate in hackathons hosted by our club. In these hackathons, members can form teams and apply knowledge that they have learned through the workshops to make a live project. These hackathons not only provide an opportunity to apply skills and work collaboratively, but also involve the thrill of competition as well as feedback from experienced developers.
